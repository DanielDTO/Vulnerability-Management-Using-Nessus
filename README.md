<h1>Vulnerability Management Using Nessus</h1>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<b>The project focuses on performing a vulnerability assessment on a series of systems using Nessus. Based on the obtained results, the necessary measures must be taken to remove any vulnerabilities present in the System. In all, the main goal is to further secure a system from any potential cyber attack that may occur as a result of exploiting a major vulnerability present in that system.
</b>
<br />
<br />

Nessus is used in performing a network scan to find any vulnerabilities present. A credential scan and non-credential scan is performed. A credential scan allows Nessus to inspect registry and services running within the system. In other words, it allows an in-depth scan of the system. 
<br />
<br />

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessuso:</b> Network Scan of system (Credential and Non-Credential Scan)
- <b>Windows 10 iso:</b> System being tested for vulnerabilities
- <b>Virtual Box:</b> Creating several VMs for scannig

<h2>Output from Non-Credential to Credential Scan Accordingly</h2>
